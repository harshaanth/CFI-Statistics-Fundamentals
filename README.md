# Statistics Fundamentals - CFI

This repository contains my work and practice exercises related to the "Statistics Fundamentals" course by CFI. The files cover key areas such as Descriptive Statistics, Central Limit Theorem (CLT) & Law of Large Numbers (LLN), and Hypothesis Testing.

## Areas Covered

### 1. Descriptive Statistics

**Key Topics Covered:**
- **Types of Data:** Qualitative vs. Quantitative data.
- **Measures of Central Tendency:**
  - **Mean:** Average value.
  - **Median:** Middle value.
  - **Mode:** Most frequent value.
- **Measures of Dispersion:**
  - **Range:** Difference between highest and lowest values.
  - **Variance:** Average of squared differences from the mean.
  - **Standard Deviation:** Square root of variance.
- **Skewness and Kurtosis:** Measures of asymmetry and peakedness.

**Practical Applications:**
- **Data Summarization:** Excel functions for calculating statistics.
- **Graphical Representation:** Histograms, bar charts, and box plots.

### 2. Central Limit Theorem (CLT) & Law of Large Numbers (LLN)

**Key Topics Covered:**
- **Central Limit Theorem (CLT):** Sampling distribution of the sample mean approximates a normal distribution as sample size increases.
- **Law of Large Numbers (LLN):** Sample mean converges to population mean with larger sample sizes.

**Practical Applications:**
- **Sampling Methods:** Importance of sample size.
- **Probability Distributions:** Applying the normal distribution.

### 3. Hypothesis Testing

**Key Topics Covered:**
- **Null and Alternative Hypotheses:**
  - **Null Hypothesis (H0):** No effect or difference.
  - **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** Contradicts H0.
- **Types of Errors:**
  - **Type I Error (α):** Rejecting H0 when it is true.
  - **Type II Error (β):** Failing to reject H0 when it is false.
- **P-value and Significance Level:** Probability of observing data under H0.
- **Test Statistics:**
  - **Z-test:** For large samples or known population variance.
  - **T-test:** For small samples or unknown variance.

**Practical Applications:**
- **Hypothesis Testing with Excel:** Conducting tests and interpreting p-values.
